# Conv-TasNet
tensorflow 2.x implementation of Conv-TasNet, Y Luo et al.(2018)

`.py` structure is more appropriate for this project, but I used the jupyter notebook with the `import_ipynb` module, in order to make things more natural.

Main files are `CV_Tasnet_Model.ipynb`, `CV_Tasnet_CustomTraining.ipynb`, `CV_Tasnet_main.ipynb`, and `CV_Tasnet_Unused.ipynb` is just for record.

As the WSJ0-2mix Dataset is NOT open source dataset, I used [LibriMix](https://github.com/JorisCos/LibriMix) dataset instead.
